# Youtube Looper
###### A chrome extension that can make a video loop between two given times.

### Motivation
Do you often find some portion of a song better than the whole song? and you listen to the full song again just for your favourite portion? or you keep scrolling to your favourite part manually?

This extension solves this exact problem.

### Solution
This extension solves the problem by taking two time inputs from user and sets up a loop between the two time frames.
##### Logic
At the core of this extension, Javascript's `setInterval` method is used to put the playing video on loop.

### what's next?
In the next iterations of this extension the following things will be added:
* Better UI
* support for other websites such as youtube music, spotify and other music and video streaming apps.
